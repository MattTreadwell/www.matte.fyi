# About

This is the front page of my personal website/webserver meant for displaying a simple resume/CV.
Right now it uses Bootstrap 4, Javascript, and [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).  

## Planned Features

* Control panel and login form for managing subdirectories protected by http-digest
* Animate Name Banner (potentially with Angular or ReactJS)
* Finish resume/CV portion of website
